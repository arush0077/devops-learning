## 📚 Overview

This repository contains structured knowledge, resources, and exercises to help you build a solid DevOps foundation. It is divided into several key modules:

1. [Basics](#1-basics)
2. [Git Version Control](#2-git-version-control)
3. [Linux & Terminal](#3-linux--terminal)
4. [Networking Fundamentals](#4-networking-fundamentals)
5. [Containerization with Docker](#5-containerization-with-docker)


---

## 1. Basics

Start with understanding the high-level picture of DevOps — its culture, tools, and workflows. Learn the importance of automation, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and monitoring.

---

## 2. Git Version Control

Understand and **practice the following Git and GitHub concepts**:

- ✅ Cloning, branching, committing, pushing, pulling
- ✅ Creating & reviewing MRs/PRs
- ✅ Rebasing vs Merging
- ✅ Resolving merge conflicts
- ✅ Git Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add login`, `fix: crash on submit`)
- ✅ Git logs, diffs (`git log`, `git diff`)
- ✅ `.gitignore` best practices
- ✅ GitHub Features: Issues, Projects, Discussions, Actions

---

## 3. Linux & Terminal

Get hands-on with terminal-based Linux environments. Key areas:

### 🐧 Linux Exercises

- Parse HTTP logs using a bash script (filter `GET` requests).
- Set and persist environment variables via `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
- Use `df`, `top`, and `free` to monitor system performance.

### 🖥️ Terminal Knowledge

- **Essential Commands**: `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, `chown`, `top`, `ps`, `df`, `du`
- **Navigation & Permissions**
- **Text Editors**: `vim`, `nano`
- **Services**: `systemctl` (`start`, `stop`, `enable`, `status`)
- **Logs**: `journalctl`
- **Command Techniques**: `|`, `>`, `>>`, `&&`, `||`
- **Environment Variables**: `export`, `.bashrc`
- **SSH & File Transfers**: `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`
- **Networking**: `ip`, `ping`, `curl`, `wget`
- **Package Managers**: `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`

---

## 4. Networking Fundamentals

- ✅ IPs, Subnets, CIDRs
- ✅ VPCs, Routing, and NAT
- ✅ Public vs Private Subnets
- ✅ Security Groups, NACLs

---

## 5. Containerization with Docker

### 📘 Resources

- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/guides/get-started/)

### 🧪 Exercises

- Run a PostgreSQL DB inside a Docker container.
- Create a **multi-stage Dockerfile**.
- Package a Node.js or React app using Docker.
- Understand build context and image layers.
